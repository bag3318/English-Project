Elie Wiesel was born on 30 September 1928 in Sighet--a town in Poland--now known as part of Transylvania. He was an orthodox Jew and had three sisters; two older, and one younger. Eli&rsquo;s main life was centered around his family. He and his family were very religious, and had many friends who all had the same practices as Eli&rsquo;s family (this was because he lived in a small town).
