In 1944, Elie Wiesel was deported from camp Birkenau to Camp Auschwitz. He, nor did anyone else he was with, knew what treachery was to come in this horrific camp. The gates of Auschwitz are reminiscent of those in hell. Elie Wiesel would forever remember this great cemetery. When the train stopped and the doors finally opened, there were many men with striped pajamas questioning their presence. "Why are you here?", "You shouldn't have come"; said the men.
