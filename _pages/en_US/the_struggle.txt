They were exhausted, out of breath, and had no energy left. It was then and there that everyone had collapsed to the floor on the first site of "shelter". Elie's father, unfortunately, took his last breath in the midst of suffocating while under many fallen bodies. Struggling for air, Elie squirmed until he found a small gap in between bodies where he could breath the slighest amount of air to survive.
